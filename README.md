# Clean_up
Designed a simple yet effective script that navigates to your desired directory and performs various tasks including:
1. Tagging the age of all files
2. Moving all files that are older than 'x' days (you get to specify x) to another directory that it automatically creates within the directory you mentioned for it to search. It names the new directory 'Old_files'
